#define TOTAL_BOXES_COUNT       14 // so if I'm making all pokemon/forms availale I'll need way more than 14 slots, I'm prob need to double or triple that.
#define IN_BOX_COUNT            30 //that requires save block expansion, but even after that, managing so many boxes would still be too tedious.

// I think if I can get that cfru thing, where you carry a secondary storage on you that may solve it, you can keep the important pokemon on you, and just swap from the pc.
// allowing me to cut down on the needed number of boxes.

//but I'd need to set the thing able to carry about 200 or 300 pokemon and able to register it, to change the after/catch action,
//so when it's registered caught pokemon go directly to this closer storage instead of the pc. 

//that way pressing the register button would swap the default location new pokemon go, so if you have a pokemon you want to use, right away, just hit register before you catch.
//this still requiers save expansion, but its just a more efficient interface.
